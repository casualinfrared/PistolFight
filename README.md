Python 3 and Pygame.

## Installing Pygame

To install pygame: open a console window and type in: <code>python3 -m pip install pygame</code>

### Linux

Preferably, install pygame with your distribution's package manager. On Arch Linux that would be <code>sudo pacman -S python-pygame</code>

Left CTRL = Player 1 Shoots

Arrow keys = Move Player 2

Right CTRL = Player 2 Shoot
